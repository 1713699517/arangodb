# Greylist information

In this file we collect information about which tests are currently
greylisted. Please add a reason and date, and possibly links to issues
or PRs.

 - `./tests/js/client/resilience/foxxmaster-grey.js` there is a bug in the
   test code. Alan is looking into it.

 - `./tests/js/server/resilience/moving-shards-cluster.js` and
   `./tests/js/server/resilience/repair-distribute-shards-like-spec.js`
   are both affected by the issue mentioned above, arangodb/release-3.4#125.
   The failure only occurs in practice when there's data moved around, which is
   why these tests only fail since they're run with data as well, see
   PR arangodb/arangodb#7193.
